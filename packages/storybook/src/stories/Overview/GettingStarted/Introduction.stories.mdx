## ðŸ§° The contents

Almost every components are based on [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/).

- @smartb/archetypes-ui-components regroups basic components to build an application like button, card, panel etc...

- @smartb/archetypes-ui-layout regroups complexe layouts to structure an application like nav-bar, steppers, tools-menu etc...

## ðŸŒˆ Override styles

There is a `theme provider` component in @smartb/archetypes-ui-components that has to include the app.

You have to give it a theme that you can get and customise [here](/?path=/story/overview-cheatsheet-theme--page). And you can also give it a [material-ui theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/) to override the material-ui default properties.

Every components and layouts will have the following props to easily override their default styles:

- `className` to give a class to the root of the component.
- `style` to give custom styles to the root of the component.
- `classes` An object regrouping all the classes you can give to the different parts of a component.
- `styles` An object regrouping all the custom styles you can give to the different parts of a component.

Each part of a component also has a unique class construct like that: `"Arui" + /*the name of the component*/ + "-" + /*the name of the part of the component*/`.

For Example: `AruiCard-root`.

These classes allows you to override the default css properties from a static css file.
