# A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

- Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
- Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
- Has a lot of plugins

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)

ReactDOM.render(
  <Markdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>
    {'# Your markdown here'}
  </Markdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can _also_ use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

|    Feature | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
|        GFM | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

~~strikethrough~~

- [ ] task list
- [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).
