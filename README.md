- @smartb/g2-themes regroups providers and hooks to use our theme and the material-ui theme in the application.

- @smartb/g2-s2 regroups components to work with Smartb's tools.

## üåà Override styles

There is a `theme provider` component in @smartb/g2-components that has to include the app.

You have to give it a theme ~~that you can get and customise [here](/?path=/story/overview-cheatsheet-theme--page)~~ (not yet available). And you can also give it a [material-ui theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/) to override the material-ui default properties.

Every components and layouts will have the following props to easily override their default styles:

- `className` to give a class to the root of the component.
- `style` to give custom styles to the root of the component.
- `classes` An object regrouping all the classes you can give to the different parts of a component.
- `styles` An object regrouping all the custom styles you can give to the different parts of a component.

Each part of a component also has a unique class construct like that: `"Arui" + /*the name of the component*/ + "-" + /*the name of the part of the component*/`.

For Example: `AruiCard-root`.

These classes allows you to override the default css properties from a static css file.
